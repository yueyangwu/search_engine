          </h1>
          <p>
            Google’s social and sharing products and services enable people from diverse
            backgrounds to start conversations, share experiences, collaborate on projects, and
            form new communities. Our policies play an important role in maintaining a positive
            experience for our users. Please follow these policies when using Google+ (including
            Google+ comments on other products such as Blogger), participating in public Hangouts
            or Hangouts on Air, sending Hangouts invitations, and sharing content by link through
            Google Photos (collectively referred to below as the “Services”).
          </p>
          <p>
            We depend heavily upon users to let us know about content that may violate our
            policies. After we are notified of a potential policy violation, we may review the
            content and take action, including restricting access to the content, removing the
            content, and limiting or terminating a user’s access to Google products. Note that we
            may make exceptions to these policies based on artistic, educational, or documentary
            considerations, or when there are other substantial benefits to the public from not
            taking action.
          </p>
          <p>
            We occasionally modify these policies, so please check back here for any updates.
            Beyond the policies listed below, note that several products and features may have
            additional policies and terms — please check the links provided for those additional
            requirements.

                Do not upload or share content that exploits or abuses children. This includes all
                child sexual abuse imagery (even cartoon images) and all content that presents
                children in a sexual manner. We will remove such content and take appropriate
                action, which may include disabling accounts and reporting to the National Center
                for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) and law enforcement. Note that this
                policy may additionally apply to any content uploaded or transmitted through Google
                Photos.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you find any content that you think exploits children in this manner, do not +1,
                reshare or comment on such content, even if your intent is to bring it to Google’s
                attention. Instead, flag the content through the ‘<a href=

                Abuse</a>’ link. If you find content elsewhere on the internet, please contact

                Do not engage in harassing, bullying, or threatening behavior, and do not incite
                others to engage in these activities. Anyone using our Services to single someone
                out for malicious abuse, to threaten someone with serious harm, to sexualize a
                person in an unwanted way, or to harass in other ways may have the offending
                content removed or be permanently banned from using the Services. In emergency
                situations, we may escalate imminent threats of serious harm to law enforcement.
                Keep in mind that online harassment is also illegal in many places and can have
                serious offline consequences for both the harasser and the victim.

                Our Services enable discussion of many topics, but not every topic is appropriate
                for all ages or in all countries. Because the promotion of certain products and
                services is heavily regulated, we have created tools to help you target your

              <p>
                If your content promotes regulated goods and services, including alcohol, gambling,
                pharmaceuticals and unapproved supplements, tobacco, fireworks, weapons, or
                health/medical devices, you are responsible for applying the appropriate age and
                geographical restrictions for that content. If we receive a complaint that such
                content is targeting audiences in violation of applicable laws and regulations, we
                may remove or restrict the offending content or account.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the appropriate age and geographical restrictions in place, we allow
