        <div class="entry-content"><p><em>Late last month, San Francisco&#8217;s beloved destination noodle shop, <strong>Hapa Ramen</strong>, was effectively <a href="http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2015/03/28/richie-nakano-and-hapa-ramen-split/" target="_blank">blown to smithereens</a> when the restaurant&#8217;s founder and executive chef <strong>Richie Nakano,</strong> as well as the restaurant&#8217;s 35 servers, cooks, and bartenders, were purged by new ownership. That new ownership—who <a href="http://insidescoopsf.sfgate.com/blog/2015/03/30/hapa-ramen-ownership-releases-statement-surrounding-controversial-closure/" target="_blank">dispute</a> that account—arrived only four months ago (after Nakano sold his rights to the restaurant) in the form of angel investor <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Van_Natta" target="_blank">Owen Van Natta</a></strong>, a Silicon Valley executive who&#8217;d played various roles at Facebook and Myspace. The reverberations in the Bay Area’s restaurant community were huge. </em><em>Here, food writer and Bay Area native <a href="https://twitter.com/john_birdsall" target="_blank">John Birdsall</a> responds.</em></p>
<p>Hey Owen, it’s been a busy few weeks. How’s it going?</p>
<p>You should know up-front that the point of this letter is to ask you to let Richie have the Hapa Ramen name back. But first, since we’ve never met, I should probably introduce myself.</p>
<p>Like Richie, I forged my identity as a line cook—I started in San Francisco 30 years ago, an entire generation. For the last 12 years, I’ve been writing about food here. They’re similar pursuits. Both require daily acts of creation; both pay shit. The expression part is harder than you’d think. We make ourselves vulnerable. Cooks, by turning their skills and stamina—their points of view, formed little by little, over years of work and observation—into solid expression. Food writers, by turning those things into insights and ideas.</p>
<p>It was at the first Eat Real Festival in Oakland, back in 2009, that Richie Nakano taught me something about respect—or as he’d probably put it, how not to be a little bitch. And we&#8217;ll get to that.</p>
<p>But before that, I remember—it must have been early 2009—showing up to one of the Hapa Ramen test events, in the driveway of Richie’s apartment in San Francisco. This was <em>six years ago</em>. I ate ramen with people I didn’t know. Friends or fans who’d brought beer or wine, like a party, filled out questionnaires afterwards to give feedback on taste and timing. I think of all that work now, all that planning and worry and laying the ground, and feel nothing but regret. You probably feel it, too. In this business, striving is something you count not in months, but in years.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s made everybody realize that what we value about the restaurant scene in San Francisco is dependent on whether or not a wealthy guy gets pissed off enough to fire somebody.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We endure those years in a culture, in a discipline. It’s not an easy life, believe me, and not just because constant expression takes a psychic toll. As a chef, you learn early to divorce money from effort—if you work 16 hours in a day, your salary doesn’t double. If you keep bitching about money in this business, you end up losing the respect of your peers. <strong>And respect is everything in this business, Owen. Nobody does it for the money.</strong></p>
<p>I’m pointing this out because I was appalled—shaken, more like it. It&#8217;s not just me, but really, everybody I’ve talked to in the San Francisco restaurant community (which, like it or not, you’re now a big player in) at the way you (and your employee, Deborah Blum) handled this thing with Richie.</p>
<p><strong>The good thing is you have an opportunity to fix it. </strong>That’s why I’m writing to you now.</p>
<hr style="border: none;"/>
<p>I stress this point about money because I assume that’s probably hard for you, a man of some achievement in the technology sector, with a house on the Peninsula, to understand this (a house, I’ve read, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/owen-van-natta-house-photos-2011-5" target="_blank">which cost more than Mark Zuckerberg’s</a>). My assumption is that in tech—as in business generally—money is interchangeable with power, the thing that gives a man like you (and let’s face it, you&#8217;re all men) his sense of worth. Making a solid deal gives you face in business. I understand that.</p>
<p>The food community works the opposite way.</p>
<p>Here, a chef gets her or his sense of worth by making things and turning those things into a cohesive expression. When she or he is successful, they can support a whole, small universe of bussers and cooks and servers who in turn support their kids or boyfriends, or send money home to their wives in Mexico. That’s why this is a community, Owen, and not merely an industry, despite how cliché the word “community” is now. It’s an intimate, a personal circle that we work in.</p>
<p>As absurd as it sounds, despite the fact that we&#8217;re talking about a business where ego and tempers and—I’ll admit it—drinking and drugs all play a part, still, it has a rigorous code of honor. That’s why cooks tattoo themselves, Owen: Your work, the discipline that you steel yourself in, day after day—it becomes you, and everybody can see it. There’s no hiding. We all get to take the measure, eventually, of everybody who cooks or writes about food or manages a bar here. That’s how I know Richie is a person of integrity, a man who trusted you, the way his cooks trusted him. You don’t essentially apprentice yourself to a chef, Owen, by first insisting on a contract. You do it on trust.</p>

<p>Now, you probably knew, when you paid Richie $20,000 for the Hapa name, and then paid him a salary, as Hapa’s executive chef, on par with a public school teacher’s (not even enough for a guy with kids to live in a decent place in the Mission these days), that a chef isn’t motivated by money. I bet you knew that, Owen. I bet you knew you had all the leverage.</p>
<p><strong>But what you’ve done, Owen, by purchasing what a chef built over more than five years, from nothing—built it through skill and personality, talent and perseverance—and then dishonoring the builder? That’s sent a deep tremor through the local chef community, and rattled the national one.</strong> You probably just thought you were cutting a guy who seemed like an asshole (I get it, Richie can be abrasive; he says things in public that a lot of us say only privately). You were solving a problem. Swatting a fly. I can see how that could make business sense to a guy who doesn’t understand the culture of food and restaurants here.</p>
<p>But the rest of us? We&#8217;re wondering if this is how it’s going to be in San Francisco—if you’re the tech bro kicking the Latino kids off the Mission soccer field, because you have a piece of paper in your hand. It’s made everybody realize that what we value about the restaurant scene in San Francisco is dependent on whether or not a wealthy guy gets pissed off enough to fire somebody.</p>
<p>That plays against this idea we have of chefs as auteurs, building businesses around artistic vision. <strong>What the Hapa Ramen story makes us all fear is that it’s really a guy texting from a $9 million Tudor-style mansion in the residential luxury zone of Silicon Valley who decides what plays, determines the real culture of the Mission. </strong>Gets to say who stays, who goes home. Who then plies that privilege with lawyers and contracts.</p>
<hr style="border: none;"/>
<p>It tells us in the restaurant community that we’re nothing more than a bunch of tattooed, underpaid little serfs. That makes us scared. And it makes us mad enough to want to do something that makes us stop feeling scared. Maybe you’ll open a new restaurant in the Hapa space that’ll be amazing—better than Richie’s, though I was a fan—but, let’s face it, Owen, it’s going to be a hard sell for this little but feverishly engaged community you’re now a part of. I won’t lie to you, it’s going to be a hard sell. I mean, you were a Facebook guy, right? You know how people talk on social media.</p>

<p>I read somewhere that you’ve <a href="http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/last-street-standing?page=3" target="_blank">bought up three properties near Mission and 18th or 19th</a>, besides the Hapa one, and that you have this idea to leave something for your daughters, a community legacy. I don’t have kids, Owen, but if I did, I know I’d try to teach them how to be honorable, the way my dad taught me. I used to work beside a prep cook who had a noble name, Balthazar Bencomo. He lived in that part of the Mission, shared a room with a bunch of guys so he could send all his money to his wife and kids in the Yucatan—that’s a level of integrity you and I will probably never achieve, Owen, despite what we might want to show our children.</p>
<p>That brings me back to where I started, and Eat Real in 2009. That first festival had a series of readings—they invited writers to come to Jack London Square and talk about street food, and me and Richie, who had a blog and had pretty much just started doing Hapa pop-ups, were on the same bill.</p>
<hr style="border: none;"/>
<p>There were maybe a dozen of us on the bill that night—I was number nine or ten on the program, a few speakers past Richie. One by one, food writers I know stood up before the patchy crowd and talked about Bangkok or Mexico, then discreetly slipped out of the room, to eat, or head home. I would have done the same thing, believe me, Owen, but I could see, by the time it’d be my turn, there’d be almost nobody left to hear me.</p>
<p>Except Richie was there to hear me—he was the only speaker that night who stayed to hear the rest. He and I barely knew each other, and—I have to tell you—my talk was horrible, me holding a stack of papers I couldn’t get my nerve-shaky hand to stop rustling, my voice all cracked and quavering. Richie had the courtesy—I don’t think I’m hyping it when I call it the good grace—to stay and hear everybody out. I remember thinking: This is a lesson in respect.</p>
<p><strong>That’s how your new community works, Owen—small gestures resonate over years to set your reputation.</strong> Yeah, there’s ego and scrabbling after small money in this restaurant world of ours: People say stupid things, they drink and act out, Tweet shit they have to delete next morning. But there’s respect for expression, for owning the things you create through hard work and putting yourself out there, day after day, night after night.</p>
<p>And here’s where I lay out my pitch, the point of all this:</p>
<hr style="border: none;"/>
<p><strong>Give Richie back the Hapa Ramen name.</strong></p>
<p>As an expression of Richie’s heritage—part white, part Asian, fused in Hawaii—hell, it doesn’t even fit you. It’s like taking a chef’s skin, ink and all, just because you can. You’re part of a community now where small gestures of respect resonate louder than packed dining rooms.</p>
<p>Do the right thing.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>-John Birdsall</p>

Nobody does it for the money.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nI\u2019m pointing this out because I was appalled\u2014shaken, more like it.\u00a0It's\u00a0not just me, but really, everybody I\u2019ve talked to in the San Francisco restaurant community (which, like it or not, you\u2019re now a big player in) at the way you (and your employee, Deborah Blum) handled this thing with Richie.\r\n\r\n<strong>The good thing is you have an opportunity to fix it. <\/strong>That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing to you now.\r\n\r\n<hr style=\"border: none;\" \/>\r\n\r\nI stress this point about money because I assume that\u2019s probably hard for you, a man of some achievement in the technology sector, with a house on the Peninsula, to understand this (a house, I\u2019ve read, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/owen-van-natta-house-photos-2011-5\" target=\"_blank\">which\u00a0cost more than Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s<\/a>). My assumption is that in tech\u2014as in business generally\u2014money is interchangeable with power, the thing that gives a man like you (and let\u2019s face it, you're all men) his sense of worth. Making a solid deal gives you face in business. I understand that.\r\n\r\nThe food community works the opposite way.\r\n\r\nHere, a chef gets her or his sense of worth by making things and turning those things into a cohesive expression. When she or he is successful, they can support a whole, small universe of bussers and cooks and servers who in turn support their kids or boyfriends, or send money home to their wives in Mexico. That\u2019s why this is a community, Owen, and not merely an industry, despite how clich\u00e9 the word \u201ccommunity\u201d is now. It\u2019s an intimate, a personal circle that we work in.\r\n\r\nAs absurd as it sounds, despite the fact that we're talking about a business where ego and tempers and\u2014I\u2019ll admit it\u2014drinking and drugs all play a part, still, it has a rigorous code of honor. That\u2019s why cooks tattoo themselves, Owen: Your work, the discipline that you steel yourself in, day after day\u2014it becomes you, and everybody can see it. There\u2019s no hiding. We all get to take the measure, eventually, of everybody who cooks or writes about food or manages a bar here. That\u2019s how I know Richie is a person of integrity, a man who trusted you, the way his cooks trusted him. You don\u2019t essentially apprentice yourself to a chef, Owen, by first insisting on a contract. You do it on trust.\r\n\r\n<hr style=\"border: none;\" \/>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cdn.firstwefeast.com\/assets\/2015\/04\/hapa.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-300989\" src=\"http:\/\/cdn.firstwefeast.com\/assets\/2015\/04\/hapa.jpg\" alt=\"hapa\" width=\"470\" height=\"382\" \/><\/a>\r\n<em>At Hapa Ramen, Nakano was credited for creating a new ramen vernacular.\u00a0Photo: Aubrie Pick<\/em><\/p>\r\nNow, you probably knew, when you paid Richie $20,000 for the Hapa name, and then paid him a salary, as Hapa\u2019s executive chef, on par with a public school teacher\u2019s (not even enough for a guy with kids to live in a decent place in the Mission these days), that a chef isn\u2019t motivated by money. I bet you knew that, Owen. I bet you knew you had all the leverage.\r\n\r\n<strong>But what you\u2019ve done, Owen, by purchasing what a chef built over more than five years, from nothing\u2014built it through skill and personality, talent and perseverance\u2014and then dishonoring the builder? That\u2019s sent a deep tremor through the local chef community, and rattled the national one.<\/strong> You probably just thought you were cutting a guy who seemed like an asshole (I get it, Richie can be abrasive; he says things in public that a lot of us say only privately). You were solving a problem.\u00a0Swatting a fly. I can see how that could make business sense to a guy who doesn\u2019t understand the culture of food and restaurants here.\r\n\r\nBut the rest of us?\u00a0We're wondering if this is how it\u2019s going to be in San Francisco\u2014if you\u2019re the tech bro kicking the Latino kids off the Mission soccer field, because you have a piece of paper in your hand. It\u2019s made everybody realize that what we value about the restaurant scene in San Francisco is dependent on whether or not a wealthy guy gets pissed off enough to fire somebody.\r\n\r\nThat plays against this idea we have of chefs as auteurs, building businesses around artistic vision. <strong>What the Hapa Ramen story makes us all fear is that it\u2019s really a guy texting from a $9 million Tudor-style mansion in the residential luxury zone of Silicon Valley who decides what plays, determines the real culture of the Mission. <\/strong>Gets to say who stays, who goes home. Who then\u00a0plies that privilege with lawyers and contracts.\r\n\r\n<hr style=\"border: none;\" \/>\r\n\r\nIt tells us in the restaurant community that we\u2019re nothing more than a bunch of tattooed, underpaid little serfs. That makes us scared. And it makes us mad enough to want to do something that makes us stop feeling scared. Maybe you\u2019ll open a new restaurant in the Hapa space that\u2019ll be amazing\u2014better than Richie\u2019s, though I was a fan\u2014but, let\u2019s face it, Owen, it\u2019s going to be a hard sell for this little but feverishly engaged community you\u2019re now a part of. I won\u2019t lie to you, it\u2019s going to be a hard sell. I mean, you were a Facebook guy, right? You know how people talk on social media.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_300991\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"470\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/cdn.firstwefeast.com\/assets\/2015\/04\/missionplayground2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-300991 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/cdn.firstwefeast.com\/assets\/2015\/04\/missionplayground2.jpg\" alt=\"missionplayground2\" width=\"470\" height=\"262\" \/><\/a> Apropos: The infamous 'Tech Bro Kicking Mission Youth\u00a0Off A Soccer Field' <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sfweekly.com\/thesnitch\/2014\/10\/14\/protest-planned-after-tech-bros-kick-mission-youth-off-soccer-field\" target=\"_blank\">video.<\/a>[\/caption]\r\n\r\nI read somewhere that you\u2019ve <a href=\"http:\/\/www.modernluxury.com\/san-francisco\/story\/last-street-standing?page=3\" target=\"_blank\">bought up three properties near Mission and 18th or 19th<\/a>, besides the Hapa one, and that you have this idea to leave something for your daughters, a community legacy. I don\u2019t have kids, Owen, but if I did, I know I\u2019d try to teach them how to be honorable, the way my dad taught me. I used to work beside a prep cook who had a noble name, Balthazar Bencomo. He lived in that part of the Mission, shared a room with a bunch of guys so he could send all his money to his wife and kids in the Yucatan\u2014that\u2019s a level of integrity you and I will probably never achieve, Owen, despite what we might want to show our children.\r\n\r\nThat brings me back to where I started, and Eat Real in 2009. That first festival had a series of readings\u2014they invited writers to come to Jack London Square and talk about street food, and me and Richie, who had a blog and had pretty much just started doing Hapa pop-ups, were on the same bill.\r\n\r\n<hr style=\"border: none;\" \/>\r\n\r\nThere were maybe a dozen of us on the bill that night\u2014I was number nine or ten on the program, a few speakers past Richie. One by one, food writers I know stood up before the patchy crowd and talked about Bangkok or Mexico, then discreetly slipped out of the room, to eat, or head home. I would have done the same thing, believe me, Owen, but I could see, by the time it\u2019d be my turn, there\u2019d be almost nobody left to hear me.\r\n\r\nExcept Richie was there to hear me\u2014he was the only speaker that night who stayed to hear the rest. He and I barely knew each other, and\u2014I have to tell you\u2014my talk was horrible, me holding a stack of papers I couldn\u2019t get my nerve-shaky hand to stop rustling, my voice all cracked and quavering. Richie had the courtesy\u2014I don\u2019t think I\u2019m hyping it when I call it the good grace\u2014to stay and hear everybody out. I remember thinking: This is a lesson in respect.\r\n\r\n<strong>That\u2019s how your new community works, Owen\u2014small gestures resonate over years to set your reputation.<\/strong> Yeah, there\u2019s ego and scrabbling after small money in this restaurant world of ours: People say stupid things, they drink and act out, Tweet shit they have to delete next morning. But there\u2019s respect for expression, for owning the things you create through hard work and putting yourself out there, day after day, night after night.\r\n\r\nAnd here\u2019s where I lay out my pitch, the point of all this:\r\n\r\n<hr style=\"border: none;\" \/>\r\n\r\n<strong>Give Richie back the Hapa Ramen name.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAs an expression of Richie\u2019s heritage\u2014part white, part Asian, fused in Hawaii\u2014hell, it doesn\u2019t even fit you. It\u2019s like taking a chef\u2019s skin, ink and all, just because you can. You\u2019re part of a community now where small gestures of respect resonate louder than packed dining rooms.\r\n\r\nDo the right thing.\r\n\r\nRespectfully,\r\n\r\n-John Birdsall\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cdn.firstwefeast.com\/assets\/2015\/04\/richieuse.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-301113\" src=\"http:\/\/cdn.firstwefeast.com\/assets\/2015\/04\/richieuse.jpg\" alt=\"richieuse\" width=\"470\" height=\"313\" \/><\/a>\r\n<em>Richie Nakano.

And you might want to take a business and investment class to understand what I actually mean by that. Richie Nakano is not a victim, he entered into a business relationship and agreed to the terms which then ended up causing him to lose the idea when he wrote over ownership to van Natta.. If you want to be mad be mad at Richie for selling out your beloved bowl of soup over the almighty dollar. Maybe all you &#8220;fans&#8221; who claim you meet &#8220;friend&#8221; in his life should have given him some business advice when the getting was good? As someone with a small idea of what it would take to turn a profit in SF food scene surely anyone with a brain could have recommended that the building of the b&amp;m in the mission maybe not have all the bells &amp; whistles so turning a profit would be easier to achieve? I.e. Mission Chinese food. If the food stands out the diners do not care about the decore. The only foolish one in this story is Richie and rather than learn and accept defeat we have to hear his child tantrum that &#8220;that&#8217;s.not.fair!!!&#8221;.

It was piss poor ramen made by a hipster for tech hipster. A hipster who happily sold the name of his business for some coin. What happened is that two hipster douches decided to business together and both acted like douches. Nakano had dreams of having his mini empire of subpar but hipster beloved ramen and got into a deal without even reading it. Both are perfect examples of what kind of people are opening businesses here and why so many actually good locals never have a chance in this new bastion of trend obsessed tech and non-tech hipster douchebags.</p>

<p>Ive seen this story play out before in SF and other cities. Hardworking chef gets a financial backer who claims to share the vision and move it in that direction. But the backer really has his own plans (as discussed above) and screws the lowly chef outta everything they created with their hardwork. </p>
<p>I dont even know Richie but I know this scenario.</p>

<p>You must have not read the link to the history of ramen. If you were in Japan around 1910, you would have seen it, as it was created by CHINESE COOKS. I&#8217;m quite aware of where the Chinese influence was in many Asian countries. If you had you would have read this, you would have understood the context of my statement. You would also know that Ramen first appeared in 1910 in JAPAN, so your unintelligent comment of 22 millions years of ancient Chinese descent means absolutely nothing in relation that what this article states. </p>
<p>Come to Los Angeles and watch Chinese, Mexicans, Koreans, Caucasians and Vietnamese make ramen. Just becuase you don&#8217;t see it, doesn&#8217;t mean it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>Ramen &#8212; although it wasn&#8217;t called that, then &#8212; first appeared in Japan in 1910, when Chinese cooks at Tokyo&#8217;s Rairaiken restaurant created a signature dish comprising broth and Chinese noodles, which were yellower and more elastic than Japanese noodles because &#8212; then as now &#8212; their dough was kneaded withkansui, a sodium-carbonate-infused alkaline mineral water.</p>

Usually it&#8217;s all ego powered and overvalued. My point of view comes as a cook that&#8217;s been grinding for years striving for a place to express myself. Richie, to me, is an icon of a proper linecook/chef with roots deep in SF. Bad business decision probably, hipster maybe&#8230; Seeing him fail reminds me that us cooks are little and powerless  and business is big powerful. Our expression attracts customers and they reap the benefits.</p>

<p>1.) This piece is incredibly, and unnecessarily, long-winded. If you&#8217;re writing to advocate for Nakano then do so. The ancillary asides are laborious and dilute any hope of a firm position while you wax on&#8230; This also has the effect of fueling unnecessary polarization that will only weaken the claimed reason for writing. </p>
<p>hint: A-holes are a-holes and it doesn&#8217;t matter what business they&#8217;re in. </p>
<p>2.) It&#8217;s silly to argue that the food industry is different &#8216;the exact opposite&#8217; than taking part in the technology sector because, as written, &#8220;{a food person} gets her or his sense of worth by making things and turning those things into a cohesive expression.&#8221; I think 10s of thousands of &#8216;tech people&#8217; would clearly disagree with the suggestion they do not create.</p>
<p>By all accounts, this guy &#8220;Owen&#8221; is likely an a-hole of epic proportions which is evermore the reason to write something not watered down by unnecessary bloat.</p>

He endured years of struggle to get his brick and mortar. Yet he wasn&#8217;t given the time to see his vision into fruition. I worked at a restaurant that received Luke warm reviews and was actually bashed by Michael Bauer in it&#8217;s first year. After it&#8217;s first year and half though received a Michelin star. Four months of open business is incredibly short to determine the potential of Hapa. If you hated it don&#8217;t eat there, they didn&#8217;t want you to come anyway. Hapa was meant for the people It spoke to, it was a niche of it own.</p>

Fact is, he made a move that he thought was the right one at the time and it ended up backfiring and that&#8217;s going to happen; with that said the SF disdain for the tech sect, yet living among it stirs this combustible pot.  What&#8217;s not mentioned is that this doesn&#8217;t stop Richie from creating, cooking, sharing his art form moving forward.. I&#8217;ve worked in the wine industry for 10 years now, I&#8217;ve seen people sell out and have it work out as well as crash and burn.  His resolve is being tested, best thing he can do is get back in the kitchen and start creating again.  Only one way to stick it to the man in this situation, it&#8217;s beat him by being better.  Good luck Richie &#8211; I&#8217;ve never had your food, you may have never had my wine, but getting back to what you do doesn&#8217;t take a label or a store front, it takes character.</p>

With my first company I ever sold this happened to me in the 2nd year when they cut many of my long time employees to move in a new direction. The company I sold my company to was not to blame for what happened, it was me. When I sold my business I didn&#8217;t put any protection in for me or my employees. On my second business sale I structured the deal very differently to make sure this never happened again. Live, learn and move on.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-18233" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I understand the mentality at play here…but there are a<br/>
couple of points that are being missed.</p>
<p>His buddy…SOLD IT.<br/>
Once you sell something and just work there, it’s not yours<br/>
anymore.  All of the ire here is directed<br/>
at the “Tech Guy” because in SF it’s popular to hate “Tech Guys” at the moment…especially<br/>
with Google employees being willing to pay more for rent and offsetting the<br/>
rental prices in the area…but I digress.</p>
<p>1.<br/>
 To use a metaphor…if<br/>
I buy a car from someone, then let them be my chauffer…and he calls my wife a<br/>
bitch…he gets fired.  If doesn’t matter<br/>
how well he drives, it doesn’t matter if he considers himself an artist at<br/>
driving, and his spotless driving record will probably not be in play either.</p>
<p>2.<br/>
 If the<br/>
purchase amount and the terms seem unfair…please bear in mind that it was what captain<br/>
noodle agreed to.  It’s easy to be pissed<br/>
off at the rich guy who bought the place…but lets remember that the canonized cook<br/>
sold this mythical place.  He may have<br/>
built it with his own two hands, but he is the one who sold your little<br/>
paradise for less than the price of a reasonably prices new car.</p>
<p>3.<br/>
The food service business is the BUSINESS of<br/>
food service.  And it is cutthroat as a<br/>
motherfucker….and always has been….EVERYWHERE. </p>
<p>4.<br/>
The “tattooed cook” being expendable has ALWAYS<br/>
been a looming specter in the business…and I’m speaking from personal<br/>
experience on that.  But if the cook<br/>
needs to gain perspective…have him talk to ANY WAITRESS…EVER.  Cooks are at least considered relatively<br/>
skilled labor.  More often than not…INCLUDING<br/>
IN THE MISSION DISCTRICT…if a server messes up, they will fire them and have someone<br/>
who looks just like them in their place within 24 hours.</p>
<p>5.<br/>
There ARE artisans in the industry…and that fact<br/>
adds up to the value of about ½ bucket of warm hamster piss.  In the Bay area…if you have a restaurant, and<br/>
it gets less than a 4 star review, you’re gonna be closing soon….fact.  Competition in the area is so tight, and<br/>
expectations are so harsh, that with almost every restaurant in the area, it is<br/>
the equivalent of the rating system in cliff diving…there are only 2 categories…”Grand<br/>
Champion”, and “Stuff you got to scrape off a rock”.</p>
<p>6.<br/>
Even if you exclude the “Tech Guy” involvement,<br/>
you might want to remember that there is no place in the bottom line for<br/>
adoration, and the banks do not accept “community love” in leu of payment.  And a vast majority of the time when truly<br/>
excellent places close or change, people lament it without ever taking into<br/>
account that they have a bad business plan, aren’t making enough money on their<br/>
own, or that the food was not enough to offset the conduct of the staff.</p>
<p>7.<br/>
Restaurant culture is based on the evolution of<br/>
taste and preference for success.  Change<br/>
happens…ALL the time.  And to be blunt…making<br/>
it to the point where you can sell it and make ANY kind of profit is NOT a<br/>
failure.  If it were not for the<br/>
alteration of expectation and phased die off of old ways, food trucks would<br/>
still just be vans that sell barely edible food to construction workers.</p>
<p>8.<br/>
Finally…this guy KNEW he was an employee, and<br/>
the writer of the article admits that the cook in question would “say things in<br/>
public that anyone else would only say in private”.  Not…a recipe…for longevity.  Many people who transition from ownership to<br/>
being managed forget that there are expectations on conduct.  This is neither new, or is it limited to the<br/>
food service industry.</p>
<p>In summary…too bad it happened, but go fucking cry.  Speak with your dollars.  Boycott if you want.  Start a Kickstarter campaign to let “Cooky<br/>
McTalk-Back” start another restaurant so he can learn from his past mistakes,<br/>
or just STFU.</p>

<p>Thing is, John, this is business. Owen might be a sleaze. He most likely does not care about your tattooed community circle jerks in peoples garages tasting the &#8220;next best thing&#8221; since the last &#8220;next best thing&#8221; that all the neckbeards will flock to in lock-step like lemmings. But he also knows he can make some bucks off of the &#8220;I ate it there before anyone else did&#8221; crowd. It sucks, John, but it&#8217;s business. </p>
<p>Richie made a bad mistake, John. He got into bed with someone that he shouldn&#8217;t have. Happens everyday. Just because he put 5+ years into this. Blood sweat an tears into this. Hard work and determination into this. He should just get a do-over because he couldn&#8217;t figure out how to make it work with his new parter. Thats just silly, John.</p>
<p>Olympic athletes put in blood, sweat and tears. Hard work. More that 5 years of dedication too, John. Should we just give them all medals because they tried hard? Because the athletic community is such a tight knit community and is super neato? No, John. We probably shouldn&#8217;t. Because that would make the athletes that worked a bit harder, bled a little more, or that were smart enough to not just jump in bed with the first person that waved some cash in front of their face on equal footing with the fools that left the gym early a few too many nights. </p>
<p>Richie screwed himself, John. Time for everyone to realize that we dont always get what we want, just because we want it.</p>

While I understand the point in this letter to give him the name back, which they should, not because its the right thing to do(he sold his brand); but it makes sense for them to move on and start fresh. I just think that talking about how we chefs do it for the art and not for the money is over played. A business is a business. I hope chef Richie does really well in the future, as a fellow cook I want him to do well, but its time for everyone to move on and be realistic&#8230;</p>

<p>Regarding the name that inspired such passionate vitriol towards him,<br/>
 Van Natta insists to Eater that, &#8220;it was always the plan to give Richie<br/>
 the name back.&#8221; After our interview, Van Natta sent Nakano notice<br/>
 that he is abandoning the Hapa Ramen brand — it is Nakano&#8217;s if he wants<br/>
 it. Nakano claims no one from the restaurant has tried to contact him<br/>
since March, but a UPS delivery notice shows the package was returned<br/>
after three delivery attempts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is unclear if Hapa Ramen was legally Nakano’s<br/>
trademark to sell in the first place. A former business partner filed<br/>
paperwork to register the Hapa Ramen trademark, but left before it was<br/>
finished. According to public records, the papers to transfer the<br/>
trademark to Nakano’s name were improperly filed and the trademark was<br/>
considered abandoned. Nakano’s claim to the brand &#8220;Hapa Ramen&#8221; was only<br/>
covered by common law and social media logins.</p>
