<p>
<strong>You May Use Various Parts of Our Service to Purchase Merchandise</strong>: Your use of our shops is subject to certain guidelines.&nbsp; In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
By ordering goods from JackThreads, I hereby authorize Landmark Trade Services, LTD., a licensed Canadian customs broker chosen by JackThreads, to act as my agent, and to transact business with Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) to clear my merchandise, account for applicable duties and taxes, to return merchandise to Landmark Trade Services LTD. and prepare and submit refund claims on my behalf for any merchandise that I return.</br> I understand that CBSA will send any refund of duties and taxes that were paid on the returned merchandise to the broker, and that I will obtain the refund directly from JackThreads. In this connection, I also authorize the customs broker to endorse any refund check issued by CBSA in my name, so that JackThreads, can be reimbursed. I also waive my need for any receipt of this transaction, which may include classification of goods, transaction number, and a breakdown of duties and taxes.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
We may, in our sole discretion, choose to not process or to cancel your order in certain circumstances. This may occur, for example, when the product or service you wish to purchase is out of stock or has been mispriced, we suspect the request is fraudulent, or in other circumstances we deem appropriate in our sole discretion.&nbsp; We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to take steps to verify your identity to process your order. We will either not charge you or refund the charges for orders that we do not process or cancel.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
We may place limits on purchases and we do not authorize the purchase of commercial quantities of our merchandise. &nbsp;We also may, among other things, restrict orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. &nbsp;We reserve the right to limit, cancel or prohibit orders that, in our judgment, appear to be placed in violation of this policy. We further reserve the right to cease doing business with customers who violate this policy.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
We accept returns on certain merchandise on a case-by-case basis. &nbsp;For our Return Policy, which may change from time to time, please click <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/returns">here</a>.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
We attempt to provide accurate descriptions of products and services on our Service. &nbsp;We &nbsp;do not warrant, however, that the descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. &nbsp;If a product or service offered on our Service is not as described, your sole remedy is to return the item, as specified in these Terms &amp; Conditions. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information or cancel orders if any information on our Service is inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order).</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
We strive to provide accurate pricing information regarding the products and services available on our Service. We cannot, however, insure against pricing errors. &nbsp;We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to not process or to cancel any orders placed for a product or service whose price was incorrectly posted on our Service as a result of an error. If this occurs, we will notify you by email. &nbsp;In addition, we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to correct any error in the stated full retail price.&nbsp; We do not guarantee that we offer the best available rates or prices and do not guarantee against pricing errors.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
We do our best to accurately calculate duties, taxes and fees when we add these charges to your order at checkout. In some cases, however, these charges may be too low or too high. We make no guarantee as to the accuracy of these charges and we will not provide any refunds for over-charging.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
Our Service may contain information regarding the availability of merchandise. &nbsp;This information can be used to estimate the likelihood that an item will be shipped immediately after you place your order. &nbsp;Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that an item listed as &ldquo;in stock&rdquo; will actually ship right away, as inventory can change significantly from day-to-day. &nbsp;In rare cases, a product or service offering may be in stock when a customer places the order, and sold out by the time we attempt to process the order. Should this happen, we will notify you by email. &nbsp;If we determine that a product or service you wish to purchase is no longer available, the item will be cancelled from your order. &nbsp;We will notify you by email.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
Any resale or distribution of products purchased through our Service is strictly prohibited.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Gift Cards may be redeemed toward the purchase of eligible products on our Service. The listed price for eligible merchandise (inclusive of any applicable taxes) purchased will be automatically deducted from the Gift Card balance. Additional or replacement cards reflecting reduced credit balances will not be issued. Any unused balance will remain in the recipient&#39;s Gift Card account when redeemed.&nbsp; If an order exceeds the amount of the Gift Card, the balance must be paid with a valid credit card or the Gift Card amount will not be applied.&nbsp; To view Gift Card balances, visit &ldquo;Your Account&rdquo; on the applicable portion of our Service.&nbsp; We may provide Gift Card purchasers and recipients with information about the redemption status of Gift Cards.</p>
<p>
Certain limitations apply to your use of Gift Cards on the Service:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
Gift Cards cannot be used to purchase other gift cards.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
Gift Cards will expire as indicated on the applicable card.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
Gift Cards cannot be refilled, transferred, resold, redeemed for cash or applied to another account, except to the extent required by law. Unused Gift Card balances in a JackThreads account may not be transferred.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
Gift Cards are not credit or debit cards. The Gift Cards are applicable exclusively in connection with the purchase of eligible merchandise.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
We will not issue physical cards in connection with this program, but will maintain Gift Card account balances as indicated above.</li>
<li style="margin-left: 0.5in;">
We have the right to close customer accounts and cancel orders, or bill alternative forms of payment, if a fake or fraudulently obtained Gift Card is redeemed and/or used to make purchases on our Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>From Time to Time We May Run Various Promotions:&nbsp; </strong>Our Service may contain or offer sweepstakes or other promotions, which may be governed by a separate set of rules that describe the sweepstakes or promotion and may have eligibility requirements, such as certain age or geographic area restrictions. It is your responsibility to read those rules to determine whether or not your participation, registration or entry will be valid and to determine the sponsor&rsquo;s requirements of you in connection with the applicable sweepstakes or promotion.</p>
<p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Transaction Terms.</strong> Thrillist Media Group Inc. makes the GoInterpay system available to facilitate the sale and delivery of products to consumers, at a price and in a currency selected by the consumer. The GoInterpay system permits the processing of orders to international addresses (outside of Thrillist Media Group Inc.’s home country) via the transfer of products to be purchased to GoInterpay for processing. By placing an order through Thrillist Media Group Inc, you acknowledge and agree that: <br><br>
(a) your transaction will be with GoInterpay, not Thrillist Media Group Inc, and will be processed by GoInterpay using the GoInterpay system; <br>
(b) upon successful verification and authentication by GoInterpay of payment information provided by you, GoInterpay will conclude the transaction at a price equal to the amounts presented to and agreed-upon by you;<br>
(c) GoInterpay shall be entitled to verify and authenticate your payment information, and if it is unable to verify this information, Thrillist Media Group Inc. representatives may contact you and/or your payment card issuer to confirm your identity and/or your intent to place the order;<br>
(d) GoInterpay makes no commitment to process the payment for your order until GoInterpay has accepted your order, and reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in its sole discretion;<br>
(e) In some jurisdictions, GoInterpay provides certain payment processing services through its affiliates or third party service providers under contract to it.<br><br>
</li>
<li><strong>Title to Goods.</strong> Due to GoInterpay’s processing methods, all products ordered/purchased by you from Thrillist Media Group Inc. are temporarily acquired by GoInterpay pursuant to a payment agreement with Thrillist Media Group Inc. After GoInterpay processes payment for the order, your order will transfer from GoInterpay to you.</li>
<li><strong>Billing.</strong> If you use a payment card or other electronic form of payment as your payment type, the charges to your account for your order will be accompanied by a reference to "<strong>GoInterpay</strong>" and "<strong>Thrillist Media Group Inc or JackThreads</strong>". In the event of the receipt of any parcel from Thrillist Media Group Inc containing only part of your order, GoInterpay will only bill you for the products actually contained and shipped in such parcel, plus relevant shipping, duty, taxes, VAT and fees. You will only be billed for products you receive.</li>
<li><strong>Brokers.</strong> You hereby authorize a licensed customs broker chosen by Thrillist Media Group Inc. to act as your agent and transact business with foreign customs and revenue authorities to arrange for clearance of your order, and account for duties and taxes on your behalf, in the interests of completing your order. You hereby grant a proxy or power of attorney (“<strong>POA</strong>”) to any carrier or broker designated by Thrillist Media Group Inc. to facilitate the clearance of the shipment. This POA authorizes the assigned customs broker or agent to act on your behalf. You agree to act as Importer of Record, and acknowledge the requirement for the POA as a reasonable condition of the service provided by GoInterpay and its designated carrier, broker or agent.</li>
<li><strong>Chargebacks, Fraud Prevention and Void Transactions.</strong> For your protection, the payment processing systems of Thrillist Media Group Inc. and GoInterpay may use various fraud prevention protocols and policies, and industry-standard verification systems, to reduce fraud and minimize chargeback risks. You must comply with such protocols and business risk policies, including card authentication, and “ship to” and “bill to” address verification. Once an order is placed, you may not change any authenticated payment information or any verified “ship to”/“bill to” address. If there is a systemic error which results in the processing or acceptance of a transaction for which authorization has been declined, that transaction shall be void.</li>
<li><strong>Customs, Duties, Taxes and Collection Fees.</strong> You are responsible for payment of any import taxes, sales tax, value added tax, and customs duties that may be levied by any government authority, and any disbursement fees, advancement fees or similar fees that may be imposed by the shipper, broker, the customs authority of the destination country or other party, including any additional penalties or fees imposed by applicable tax or customs authorities (collectively, “<strong>Duties, Taxes and Fees</strong>”). The estimated Duties, Taxes and Fees (“<strong>Estimate</strong>”) may be more or less than the final actual amount of Duties, Taxes and Fees due and payable. <br>
For shipments destined to EU-member countries specifically, services will be provided to you only after you have (a) paid for the Duties, Taxes and Fees at the time of checkout/purchase and (b) explicitly agreed to become Importer of Record, which you hereby explicitly agree to.

As the Importer of Record, you agree to be ultimately responsible for importing the purchased products into the destination EU-member state.</li><br>
<li><strong>Delivered Duties Paid Destinations (Paid at Checkout).</strong> If the GoInterpay system permits prepayment, and you choose to prepay the Duties, Taxes and Fees, you agree and acknowledge that (a) the actual Duties, Taxes and Fees payable on your order may be more or less than the Estimate and (b) you will not be asked to pay more money nor will you receive any refund in the case that the actual Duties, Taxes and Fees differ from the Estimate.</li>
<li><strong>Merchant Responsibilities.</strong> Questions about your order or Thrillist Media Group Inc.'s products must be addressed to Thrillist Media Group Inc.’s, and not GoInterpay. </li>
