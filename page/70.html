          By downloading, installing, or using the Google Earth software, accessing or using the
          Google Maps service (together, the "<strong>Products</strong>" or
          "<strong>Services</strong>"), or accessing or using any of the content available within
          the Products, you agree to be bound by the following: (1) the&nbsp;<a href=
          "/policies/terms/">Google Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;(the "<strong>Universal
          Terms</strong>"); (2) the terms found on our&nbsp;<a href="legalnotices_maps.html">Legal
          Notices page</a>&nbsp;(the "<strong>Legal Notices</strong>"); and (3) the additional
          terms and conditions set forth below (the "<strong>Additional Terms</strong>"). Before
          you continue, you should read each of these three documents, as together they form a
          binding agreement between you and Google regarding your use of the Products.
          Collectively, the Universal Terms, the Legal Notices, and the Additional Terms are
          referred to as the "<strong>Terms</strong>".
        </p>
        <p>
          As a condition of downloading, accessing, or using the Products, you also agree to the
          terms of the&nbsp;<a href="/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Use of the Products</strong>. Google grants you a non-exclusive,
          non-transferable license to access the Google Maps service, to download and use the
          Google Earth software and service, and to access the Content (as defined below) within
          the Products and according to the Terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Restrictions on Use</strong>. Unless you have received prior written
          authorization from Google (or, as applicable, from the provider of particular Content),
          you must not: (a) copy, translate, modify, or make derivative works of the Content or any
          part thereof; (b) redistribute, sublicense, rent, publish, sell, assign, lease, market,
          transfer, or otherwise make the Products or Content available to third parties; (c)

          downloads or bulk feeds of any Content, including but not limited to numerical latitude

          with (i) real time navigation or route guidance, including but not limited to
          turn-by-turn route guidance that is synchronized to the position of a user's
          sensor-enabled device; or (ii) any systems or functions for automatic or autonomous
          control of vehicle behavior; (g) use the Products to create a database of places or other

          rights, or have the permission of the owner or other legal justification to use such
          content; (d) upload, post, email, transmit or otherwise make available messages that
          promote pyramid schemes, chain letters, or disruptive commercial messages or

          content, message, or communication prohibited by applicable law, the Terms or any
          applicable Product policies or guidelines; (f) download any file posted by another that
          you know, or reasonably should know, cannot be legally distributed in such manner; (g)
          impersonate another person or entity, or falsify or delete any author attributions or
          proprietary designations or labels of the origin or source of Content, software or other
          material; (h) restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the Products or
          Google services; (i) use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application, or other
          device to retrieve or index any portion of the Google services or Content, or collect
          information about users for any unauthorized purpose; (j) submit content that falsely
          expresses or implies that such content is sponsored or endorsed by Google; (k) create
          user accounts by automated means or under false or fraudulent pretenses; (l) promote or
          provide instructional information about illegal activities; (m) promote physical harm or

          Additionally, you may choose to access other third party content made available in the
          Products through Google services such as Google Gadgets. You understand and agree to the
          following: (a) Map data, traffic, directions, and related Content are provided for
          planning purposes only. You may find that weather conditions, construction projects,
          closures, or other events may cause road conditions or directions to differ from the map
          results. You should exercise judgment in your use of this Content. (b) Certain Content is
          provided under&nbsp;<a href="legalnotices_maps.html">license from third parties</a>,
          including but not limited to TomTom Global Content BV ("<strong>TomTom</strong>"), and is
          subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights owned by or licensed to

          5. Additional Terms for Google Earth. The Google Earth software is subject to United
          States export controls. By using the Google Earth software, you agree to use the software
          only for purposes that are legal, proper and in accordance with these Terms.
          Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable export and reexport control laws
          and regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations ("<strong>EAR</strong>")
